Overlap Debug Panel - Workflow Guide

This guide explains how to update letter overlap rules in the application.

Step 1: Using the Overlap Debug Panel
----------------------------------
1. Open your application and locate the Overlap Debug panel in the bottom-right corner
2. Select a letter from the dropdown menu
3. Adjust values using the sliders or number inputs:
   - Min Overlap: Sets the minimum overlap value (0.01 to 0.5)
   - Max Overlap: Sets the maximum overlap value (0.01 to 0.5)
   - Special Case: Add specific overlap values for letter pairs
     a. Select a target letter from the dropdown
     b. Adjust the overlap value for that specific letter pair

Step 2: Save and Get Updated Values
--------------------------------
1. After making changes, a "Save" button will appear in the panel
2. Click "Save" to log the updated values to the browser console
3. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
4. In the console, you'll see two logs:
   - "Saving changes for letter: [selected letter]"
   - "New rule: [formatted rule string]"
5. Copy the formatted rule string - this contains your new values

Step 3: Update letterRules.ts
---------------------------
1. The formatted rule string will look like this:
   ```typescript
     a: {
       minOverlap: 0.04,
       maxOverlap: 0.16,
       specialCases: {
         b: 0.18,
         c: 0.18,
         // ... other special cases
       },
     },
   ```
2. Share this formatted rule with the development team to update letterRules.ts
3. They will use the proper tools to update the file while maintaining its structure

Additional Notes:
---------------
- The "Reset" button will restore the original values for the selected letter
- Modified letters are marked with a dot (â€¢) in the letter dropdown
- Min Overlap cannot exceed Max Overlap (and vice versa)
- Special case values can be any value between 0.01 and 0.5
- Changes are stored in memory until saved to the file
